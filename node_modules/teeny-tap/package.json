  "readme": "# teeny-tap\n\n**Status: Experimental, Under Active Development**\n\nListen for both clicks and click-like touches (not scrolls or drags).\n\nThis library is very small and simple and focused, without any dependencies.\nIt is not a touch gesture library or a complete fastclick-style solution.\nPlenty of similar libraries exist, but none of them seemed exactly right for\nmy simple needs. For more about the purpose of the library, read [\"Why?\"](#why).\n\nThis library is heavily inspired by [tap.js](https://github.com/alexgibson/tap.js),\nwhich is no longer maintained.\n\n**[Check out the demo](http://davidtheclark.github.io/teeny-tap/demo/).**\n\n(If the demo works on your phone, would you mind tweeting me your specs,\n`@davidtheclark`? That way I can list the devices where we know it works.\nAnd of course let me know if you find any bugs!)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install teeny-tap\n```\n\nYou will need to be compiling CommonJS modules (browserify or webpack).\n\n### Browser Support\n\nIE9+ and everything help, I hope. Testing underway.\n(If you can help out by trying the demo on your mobile device, please do!)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar createTapListener = require('teeny-tap');\n\nvar docTapListener = createTapListener(document.documentElement, function(e) {\n  console.log('A tap happened!');\n});\n\n// ...\ndocTapListener.remove();\n```\n\nThat's it. Very simple. You create and remove listeners.\n\n### API\n\n#### `var tapListenerInstance = createTapListener(element, callback[, useCapture])`\n\nAdds a tap listener on `element`, using `addEventListener()`.\nWhen there's a tap, `callback` is invoked with\nthe relevant `event` as its argument (either a `click` or `touchend` event).\n\n**Returns an object with a `remove` function, for removing the listener.**\n\n#### `tapListenerInstance.remove()`\n\nRemove the listener that you added when you created `tapListenerInstance`.\n\n## Why?\n\nFor\n[react-aria-menubutton](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-menubutton),\nI need to close an open menu when the user taps/clicks outside of it.\n\nThe click event wasn't reliable: mobile Safari screws it up.\nSo I needed to **distinguish, on touch devices, between *touches\nthat are scrolling or dragging* and *touches that are clicking*,\nin situations where the regular `click` event doesn't work**.\nExisting solutions that I found weren't satisfactory for a few reasons:\n\n- jQuery or other dependencies I didn't want or need.\n\n- Many just threw in a `touchstart` or `touchend`\nlistener, in addition to the click; but that alone won't distinguish\nbetween tapping and scrolling/dragging, so it's insufficient.\nThe menu might close when you, say, scroll down in order to see more of it.\nEgad!\n\n- One solution to the detect-clicks-outside-an-element problem is to add an\nunderlay that covers the page, beneath the element, and listen for clicks on that.\nHowever, this prevents the click from getting through and actually\n*doing* something; so if I click a link outside the open menu,\nthat click only closes the menu, and I have to click *again* to\ngo where I wanted to go. Non-optimal.\n\n- A number of solutions just use `click` events, which won't\nwork on most browsers on most iPhones and iPads, due to\nmobile Safari's unique and unpleasant handling of click events.\n\n- Some went the other way, and had more fine-tuning than I want or need.\n\n[tap.js](https://github.com/alexgibson/tap.js) pretty much provided exactly what I needed,\nbut that library is no longer maintained so I made this one to carry the torch,\nto fill the need.\n\nBut know that *I do not like that this exists, do not want it to need to exist*.\nIf you know of a way to accomplish the same goal without this library,\nplease let me know!\n",
